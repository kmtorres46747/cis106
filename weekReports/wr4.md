## Basic terminology 

* **File system:** The way files are stored and organized.
* **Current directory:** The directory where you are at the moment.
* **parent directory:** Directory containing the current directory.
* **the difference between your home directory and the home directory:** "Your home directory" refers to the user's home directory. "The home directory" refers to the home directory located in the root.
* **pathname:** Indicates the location of the file in the filesystem.
* **relative path:** Location of a file starting from the current working directory or a directory that is located inside the current working directory.
* **absolute path:** Location of a file starting from the root of the file system.
